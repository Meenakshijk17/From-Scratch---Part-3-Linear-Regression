# From Scratch - Part-2: Linear Regression

### Aim
This project aims to develop and implement linear regression algorithm from scratch, without using ML libraries like Scikit-Learn.


### Motivation - More than just a *model.fit()*
Engaging in manual implementation of linear regression is crucial for mastering this foundational machine learning method. This hands-on approach elucidates key concepts such as parameter adjustment and model convergence. Through customization and experimentation, practitioners gain practical insights into hyperparameter tuning and mitigating overfitting. Crafting the algorithm from scratch deepens understanding and fosters critical thinking, empowering practitioners to tailor solutions to diverse use cases. This exercise advances proficiency in linear regression, enhancing skills essential for data science practitioners.
